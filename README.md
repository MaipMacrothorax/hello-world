# hello-world
Welcome to my little corner of the digital jungle!

I'm **Maip Macrothorax** — a 20-year-old dinosaur enthusiast currently studying **Economic Data Science** in Central Europe.  
This repository is just me exploring new tools, breaking things (sometimes intentionally), and having fun while learning.⚙️

I chose the name *Maip Macrothorax* because:  
1. I really like dinosaurs.  
2. It's fun to say.  
3. It sounds like a boss-level Python package.
