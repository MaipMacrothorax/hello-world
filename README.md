# hello-world
Welcome to my little corner of the digital jungle!

I'm **Maip Macrothorax** ‚Äî a 20-year-old dinosaur enthusiast currently studying **Economic Data Science** in Central Europe.  
This repository is just me exploring new tools, breaking things (sometimes intentionally), and having fun while learning. üß†‚öôÔ∏è

I chose the name *Maip Macrothorax* because:  
1. I really like dinosaurs.  
2. It's fun to say.  
3. It sounds like a boss-level Python package.

## Here's a tiny Python snippet that sums up my vibe:

```python
class DinoDev:
    def __init__(self, name, age, passion):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.passion = passion
    
    def roar(self):
        print(f"{self.name} roars: 'I love {self.passion} and building cool stuff!'")

me = DinoDev("Maip Macrothorax", 20, "Data Science")
me.roar()
